### Introduction
Ideally, patients should be able to access hospital services easily. However, in reality, hospitals often experience congestion due to the high number of different users. This congestion affects equipment utilization and maintenance. In addition, there is often ignorance and lack of interest from both patients and employees, especially when equipment and services are not well organized.

A biometric system can help address these challenges by reducing costs for patients and enabling doctors to attend to a larger number of people in a shorter period of time.
